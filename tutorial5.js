//Arrays are a data structure that can be used to store lists of data.
let products = ['milk', 'bread','eggs'];
console.log(products);
console.log(products[1]);// Used to print the second element in the array
// Arrays assign values starting at 0,1,2,3 etc.
console.log(products.length); //Used to find out how many elements are in an array.

products.push('cheese');
console.log(products);
//Push is a method that adds another item to the end of the array.
